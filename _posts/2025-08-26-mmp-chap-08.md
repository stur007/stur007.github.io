## Chapter 8 Deep inelastic scattering

Due to the finite proton size, elastic scattering at high $q^2$ is unlikely and <mark>inelastic reactions where the proton breaks up dominate</mark>.  

### Electron-proton inelastic scattering

The hadronic final state resulting from the break-up of the proton usually consists of many particles.  

#### Kinematic variables for inelastic scattering

1. the invariant mass of the hadronic system, $W=p_4^2 = (p_2+q)^2$.

2. the negative four-momentum squared of the virtual photon, $Q^2 = -q^2$.

3. Bjorken $x$: $x = \frac {Q^2}{2p_2\cdot q }$

   Apparently

$$
   \begin{aligned}
   W &= p_4^2 \\
   &= (p_2+q)^2\\
   &= p_2^2+2p_2\cdot q+q^2\\
   &= m_p^2+2p_2\cdot q-Q^2\\
   \end{aligned}
$$

$$
   x = \frac{Q^2}{Q^2+W-m_p^2}
$$

   For elastic interaction, $W=m_p^2$, thus $x =1$; for inelastic interaction, $W > m_p^2$, thus $0<x<1$.

4. $y = \frac{p_2\cdot q}{p_2\cdot p_1}$

   Apparently

$$
   \begin{aligned}
   y &= \frac{p_2\cdot q}{p_2\cdot p_1}\\
   &= \frac{m_p(E_1-E_3)}{m_pE_1}\\
   &= 1- \frac{E_3}{E_1}
   \end{aligned}
$$

   As $E_3<E_1$, $0<y<1$.

5. $v = \frac{p_2\cdot q}{m_p}$

   Similar to y, we obtain

$$
   v = E_1-E_3
$$

#### Inelastic scattering at low $Q^2$

For electron–proton scattering at relatively low electron energies, both elastic and inelastic scattering processes can occur.

In the deep inelastic region (higher values of $W$), the near $Q^2$ independence of the cross section implies **a constant form factor**(describes the distribution of charges and magnetic momentum), from which it can be concluded that **deep inelastic scattering occurs from point-like (or at least very small) entities within the proton.**  

### Deep inelastic scattering  

Rosenbluth formula in fixed-target frame for elastic scattering:

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4 E_1^2\sin^4(\frac \theta 2)}\frac{E_3}{E_1}\left(\frac{G_E^2+\tau G_M^2}{1+\tau}\cos^2\frac \theta 2+2\tau G_M^2\sin^2\frac\theta 2\right)
$$

#### Structure functions

For inelastic scattering:

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm  d x\mathrm d Q^2} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{Q^4}\left[\left(1-y-\frac{m_p^2y^2}{Q^2}\right)\frac{F_1(x, Q^2)}{x}+y^2 F_2(x, Q^2)\right]
$$

For deep inelastic scattering, where $Q^2 \gg m_p^2y^2$:

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm  d x\mathrm d Q^2} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{Q^4}\left[\left(1-y\right)\frac{F_2(x, Q^2)}{x}+y^2 F_1(x, Q^2)\right]
$$

##### Bjorken scaling and the Callan–Gross relation

The first observation, known as Bjorken scaling, was that both $F_1(x, Q^2)$ and $F_2(x, Q^2)$ are (almost) independent of $Q^2$, allowing the structure functions to be written as

$$
F_1(x, Q^2) \to F_1(x) ;\quad F_2(x, Q^2) \to F_2(x)
$$

The second observation was that in the deep inelastic scattering regime , the two structure functions satisfy the Callan-Gross relation:

$$
F_2(x) = 2xF_1(x)
$$

This observation can be explained by assuming that the underlying process in electron–proton inelastic scattering is the elastic scattering of electrons from point-like spin-half constituent particles within the proton, namely the quarks.  

### Electron–quark scattering 

In the quark model, the underlying interaction in **deep inelastic scattering** is the QED process of $e^-q \to  e^-q$ **elastic scattering** and the deep inelastic scattering cross sections are related to the cross section for this **quark-level process**. 

Similar in e-p scattering, we have (in Chapter 5)

$$
M_{fi} = \frac{Q_qe^2}{q^2}[\bar u(p_3)\gamma^\mu u(p_1)]g_{\mu\nu}[\overline u(p_4)\gamma^\nu u(p_2)]
$$

And(in Chapter 6)

$$
\langle|M_{fi}|\rangle^2 =  2Q_q^2e^4\frac{s^2+u^2}{t^2} = 2Q_q^2e^4\frac{(p_1\cdot p_2)^2+(p_1\cdot p_4)^2}{(p_1\cdot p_3)^2}
$$

![image-20250826125247966](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stur007/img/main/img/202508261341370.png)

In the center-of-mass frame, we have

$$
p_1 = (E, 0, 0, E)\\
p_2 = (E, 0, 0, -E)\\
p_3 = (E, E\sin \theta^*, 0, E\cos\theta^*)\\
p_4 = (E, -E\sin\theta^*, 0, -E\cos\theta^*)
$$

Thus

$$
p_1\cdot p_2 = 2E^2\\
p_1\cdot p_3 = E^2(1-\cos\theta^*)\\
p_1\cdot p_4 = E^2(1+\cos\theta^*)
$$

$$
\langle|M_{fi}|\rangle^2 = 2Q_q^2e^4\frac{(p_1\cdot p_2)^2+(p_1\cdot p_4)^2}{(p_1\cdot p_3)^2}= 2Q_q^2e^4\frac{4+(1+\cos\theta^*)^2}{(1-\cos\theta^*)^2}
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega^*} =\frac{p_f^*}{64\pi^2sp_i^*}|M_{fi}|^2= \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{8\pi^2s}\frac{1+\frac 1 4(1+\cos\theta^*)^2}{(1-\cos\theta^*)^2}
$$

##### Lorentz-invariant form

$$
\frac {\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d q^2} =\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d \Omega^*}\left|\frac{\mathrm d \Omega^*}{\mathrm d q^2}\right|
$$

where

$$
t= q^2 = (p_1-p_3)^2=2E^2(1-\cos\theta^*), \Omega^* = 2\pi (1-\cos\theta^*),\left|\frac{\mathrm d \Omega^*}{\mathrm d q^2}\right|= \frac{2\pi}{2E^2} = \frac{2\pi}{s}= \frac{\pi}{p_i^{*2}}
$$

Thus

$$
\frac {\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d q^2} =\frac{1}{64\pi sp_i^{*2}}|M_{fi}|^2 =\frac{Q_q^2e^4}{32\pi sp_i^{*2}}\frac{(p_1\cdot p_2)^2+(p_1\cdot p_4)^2}{(p_1\cdot p_3)^2}= \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{8\pi q^4}\left(1+\frac{u^2}{s^2}\right)
$$

Plus(in Chapter 3)

$$
s+t+u\approx 0
$$

$$
\frac {\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d q^2} = \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{8\pi q^4}\left(1+\frac{(s+q^2)^2}{s^2}\right)
$$

### The quark-parton model

In the quark–parton model, the basic interaction in deep inelastic electron–proton scattering is **elastic scattering** from a spin-half quark within the proton, which is treated as a **free particle** in this process.

The quark–parton model for deep inelastic scattering is formulated in a frame where the **proton** has very high energy, $E \gg m_p$, referred to as the **infinite momentum frame**, where

- the mass of the proton can be neglected.
- i.e., the momentum of the struck quark(means the quark inside a hadron like a proton) transverse to the direction of motion of the proton can be neglected.

![image-20250826132607316](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stur007/img/main/img/202508261341779.png)

Therefore the 4-momentum for the struck quark

$$
p_q = \xi p_2 = (\xi E_2, 0, 0, \xi E_2)
$$

Note that

$$
m_q^2= (\xi p_2+q)^2 = \xi^2p_2^2+2\xi p_2\cdot q +q^2\approx 2\xi p_2\cdot q +q^2 \approx 0
$$

Thus

$$
\xi = \frac {-q^2}{2p_2\cdot q}=\text{ (Bjorken) }x
$$

The relations between the kinetic variables of the e-p inelastic interaction and the e-q elastic interaction:

$$
s_q = (p_1+\xi p_2)^2 = xs\\
y_q = \frac{\xi p_2\cdot q}{\xi p_2\cdot p_1}=y\\
x_q = \frac{Q^2}{2\xi p_2\cdot q} =1
$$

Thus the calculations for interactions between electrons and quarks can be useful here:

$$
\frac {\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d q^2} = \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{8\pi q^4}\left[1+\frac{(s_q+q^2)^2}{s_q^2}\right]
$$

With(Chapter 8)

$$
q^2 = -(s_q-m_q^2)x_qy_q \approx -sy
$$

we have

$$
\frac {\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d q^2} = \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{8\pi q^4}\left[1+(1-y)^2\right]
$$

i.e.,

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d Q^2} = \frac{Q_q^2e^4}{4\pi Q^4}\left[(1-y)+\frac {y^2}{2}\right]
$$

#### Parton distribution functions

The quarks inside the proton will interact with each other through the exchange of gluons. The dynamics of this interacting system will result in a **distribution** of quark **momenta** within the proton. These distributions are expressed in terms of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs). Say up-quark for example, 

$$
u^p(x)\delta x
$$

represents the **number** of up-quarks within the proton with momentum **fraction** between $x$ and $x + \delta x$(density of number).  

According to the definition above, we have (with $\alpha = \frac {e^2} {4\pi}$)

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm d x\mathrm d Q^2}= \frac{4\pi \alpha^2}{Q^4}\left[(1-y)+\frac{y^2}{2}\right]\sum_i Q_i^2 q_i^p(x)
$$

where the sum is calculated over all kinds of quarks.

Back to the structure of deep inelastic interaction(Chapter 8):

$$
\frac{\mathrm d \sigma}{\mathrm  d x\mathrm d Q^2} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{Q^4}\left[\left(1-y\right)\frac{F_2(x, Q^2)}{x}+y^2 F_1(x, Q^2)\right]
$$

we have $F_1 = \frac 1 2\sum_i Q_i^2 q_i^p(x), \quad F_2 = x \sum_i Q_i^2 q_i^p(x), \quad F_2 = 2xF_1$.

> This is due to the underlying process being elastic scattering from **spin-half Dirac particles**; the quark magnetic moment is **directly related to its charge** and therefore the contributions from the electromagnetic ($F_2$) and the pure magnetic ($F_1$) structure functions are fixed with respect to one another.  

#### Determination of the parton distribution functions 

In the static model of the proton, it is formed from **two up-quarks and a down-quark**, and it might be expected that only up- and down-quark PDFs would appear in this sum.

For proton,

$$
F_2^{ep}(x) = x\left(\frac 4 9 u_p(x)+\frac 1 9d_p(x)+\frac 4  9\bar u_p (x)+\frac 1 9 \bar d_p (x)\right)
$$

Similarly for neutron,

$$
F_2^{en}(x) = x\left(\frac 4 9 u_n(x)+\frac 1 9d_n(x)+\frac 4  9\bar u_n (x)+\frac 1 9 \bar d_n (x)\right)
$$

According to the isotope symmetry of proton and neutron, we have

$$
d_p=u_n=u, d_n = u_p=u
$$

 And 

$$
F_2^{ep}(x) = x\left(\frac 4 9 u(x)+\frac 4  9\bar u (x)+\frac 1 9d(x)+\frac 1 9 \bar d (x)\right)
$$

$$
F_2^{en}(x) = x\left(\frac 1 9u(x)+\frac 1 9 \bar u (x)+\frac 4 9 d(x)+\frac 4  9\bar d (x)\right)
$$

#### Valence and sea quarks  

The picture of a proton as a bound state consisting of three “valence” quarks is overly simplistic. The proton not only contains quarks, but also contains of a sea of **virtual gluons** that give rise to an antiquark component through $g \to  q\bar q$ pair production.
