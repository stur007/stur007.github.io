This is not a commentary blog on the TV series, as I barely recall the complicated plots for all 5 seasons; nor is it a weekly report on my daily life, for it would be boring and tedious to share. Therefore, I determine to retell the story with my thoughts about the classic TV series *Prison Break*, trying my best to think more deeply and live with a bit more humor.

Actually, I finished the last episode early this year, but at that time I was drowning in the endless ocean of final exam, occupied by the academic burden and unable keep track of my idea and actually I didn't have a strong feeling for it. These days, I happened to find some clips of this, and I reckon it's the right time to collect my feelings toward it. 

Looking back, the main story line seems to be trivial now, but I was attracted when I first heard of it: The younger brother Michael Scofield believes his older brother Lincon Burrows who is accused of murdering somebody is innocent, so he intentionally commits a crime, making himself in the same prison of his brother, helping his brother escape from the Fox River Prison. Luckily this risky operation ends up successfully (the ending is almost definite or the people will tear the director into pieces if Lincoln died). At the first time watching I was truly zealous about the intense and thrilling scenes in it, and the filming skill is cinematography, just like the techniques used in a real film, but the following episodes are almost replay the same things over and over again, so there's no need to repeat them. 

When I was watching some wonderful clips once again, it occurred to me this series also holds a deeper value, particularly in Season 1. Michael is well educated and trained as a skilled architect, so he is confident about the whole plan he made and I suppose he would easily make Lincoln out under his operation. However, he gets into a swamp of trouble almost at the first day of his prison life, more than once his plan is nearly failed. Even the last time of their trial, I think far more than half of their success comes from God. I know for sure this is just the imaginary plot, but it truly reflected something in the real life. We can make precise plans for tomorrow's raining, but we can never make sure that everything will act as what we planned. We need learn to face the fact sometimes we tried hard but failed. But it's also a fact that if we don't try our best, we would never know how far we can go. Just like the end in Season 4, after all the lightnings and storms, Michael get married with his beloved girlfriend, but he died from the diseases sooner after, everyone is back on track, as if nothing happened on the beach. All these ups and downs are left, but I still believes something is memorable, for the courage to fight against the authorities and to love what they want.

And now back to my own experience. The previous weekend almost wore me out, I had to deal with the frustrating errors from dawn to dusk, but I finally completed the whole task yesterday evening. Then my phone sent me a short bibliography of the actor Miller (played Michael in the TV series), and I was somewhat touched by what he went through before and after the shooting of the TV series. Unlike the character he played, he always follows the rules and tries to be a decent man albeit a man of great depth. It's also a successful life I have to say, and I know you have to give up something if you truly crave something. And that's the real life. We are destinated to take pains and harvest happiness, just like the ups and downs both in the film and the life. The whole world is a gambling game, if you want to gain, you need to invest first. That's how we can live our lives.

# Reflections on Prison Break

This is not a commentary blog on the TV series, for I can hardly recall the winding plots of all five seasons; nor is it a weekly report on my daily routine, which would be as dull and tedious as the ticking of a clock. Instead, I wish to weave the story together with my own reflections on the classic TV series Prison Break, trying my best to think a little deeper and live a little lighter.

I finished the final episode in early this year. Yet at that time, I was drowning in the endless sea of final exams, weighed down by academic burdens and unable to gather my thoughts. Recently, I stumbled upon a few clips from the show, and something stirred in me. Perhaps it’s the right moment now—to collect my scattered feelings and let them settle into words.

Looking back, the storyline may appear ordinary, almost predictable. But when I first encountered it, I was utterly fascinated. The younger brother, Michael Scofield, believes with unwavering faith that his older brother, Lincoln Burrows—accused of murder—is innocent. So he commits a crime himself, deliberately entering Fox River Prison to rescue his brother from within. It is a reckless, almost poetic act of love. Unsurprisingly, the plan succeeds in the end—after all, had Lincoln died, the viewers might have torn the director to shreds.

The first season gripped me with its intensity. Every episode was charged with tension, every second a breath held tight. The cinematography was cinematic in its precision, so finely tuned that it felt more like a film than a TV show. Yet as the seasons went on, the plot began to circle back upon itself—endless escapes, betrayals, and chases. The repetition dulled the sharpness, and the thrill began to fade.

Still, when I rewatched some of the brilliant clips, I realized Prison Break holds more than just surface-level excitement. Beneath the suspense lies something deeper—especially in the first season. Michael, a well-educated architect, enters the prison armed with intelligence, calculation, and confidence in his blueprint of salvation. Yet, from the very first day, his plan unravels. One misstep leads to another, and again and again he finds himself standing on the edge of failure. Even in their final attempt, I believe half their success is owed to luck—or perhaps to God’s invisible hand.

Yes, it is fiction. But it mirrors reality more closely than it seems. We, too, design our lives like architects—building plans, setting goals, calculating every risk. Yet the world often laughs at our precision. We can predict tomorrow’s rain but never guarantee what the morning will bring. Sometimes we fight with all our strength and still fail. But if we never try, we’ll never know how far we can go.

Season 4 ends like the calm after a storm. After all the lightning and thunder, Michael finally marries the woman he loves—only to die soon after from illness. Life moves on, as if nothing happened on that quiet beach. Yet what remains is not the tragedy, but the courage—the defiance against fate, and the tenderness of loving something so fiercely that it hurts.

And now, back to my own story. Last weekend nearly drained me completely. From dawn till dusk, I wrestled with endless, stubborn errors, but by yesterday evening, I finally completed my task. Just as I was about to rest, my phone flashed a short biography of Wentworth Miller, the actor who played Michael. Reading about his struggles before and after Prison Break touched me deeply. Unlike his daring on-screen persona, Miller is a man of restraint and quiet dignity—a perfectionist who obeys the rules yet hides storms within.

His journey reminded me of a truth that echoes through both fiction and life: to gain something meaningful, you must be willing to lose something else. Life is, after all, a delicate exchange—a wager between pain and joy, courage and fear. We are destined to endure hardship and chase happiness, to fall and rise again, again and again. The whole world is like a vast game of chance; if you wish to win, you must first place your bet.

That, perhaps, is how we truly live.
