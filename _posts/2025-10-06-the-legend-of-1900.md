A few days ago, I watched a movie that is kind of old but classic ,I believe, called *the Legend of 1900* (1998), and I'm going to record some of my thoughts here.

The plot is somewhat cliche: A genius was born on a ship called *Virginia* as an orphan in the first month of 1900, grew up as an excellent pianist one the ocean, fell in love with a girl but didn't visit her anymore for the fear of the land, and finally ended up dying with the explosion of the decaying ship.

The audience gets to know this story through a trumpeter named Max, who left the ship before the World War and later got into the financial trouble, having to sell his favorite instrument to make a living. 

At the first glance, I was attracted by this actor Tim Roth, who also plays Dr. Lightman in the TV series *Lie to Me*, where he showed a skillful performance that left a deep impression on me. In this movie, I was deeply touched again by the main character 1900, played by the same actor. Compared to the TV series where he showed the doctor's expertise in the microexpressions and the kind overconfidence that irritated people around him, 1900 was a juvenile who never set foot on the land of industry and stayed pure all his life, which made me find him truly adorable. When he played his piano for both aristocrats and proletarians injected his full emotions and thoughts, even when he listened to his opponents, I began to feel a kind of envy for his natural devotion to music. So when he refused to get off of the ship and decided to perish with it, it was such a heartbreaking moment, especially when he told the jokes about himself. 

At the same time there are also some thoughtful scenes and lines for me. 1900 was too naive and shy to say hi to his girl, when he finally decided to get down the ship, he stayed on the stairs, as if he were dizzy at the thought of getting down, which seemed to be a little puzzled for me. Just as what he always said, "Lose your sea legs?", we all have our comfort zones and some place horrible for us, when we were chanlleged by them, it's good to brave the elements, but it's also okay to live the life we want and are suited for, only if we loved the world we live in.

Another interesting sentence is about 1900's view of the relationship between the ocean and the land. He believed the keys on the piano(or the life on the deck) were finite, however the bulidings on the land were infinite to play with. Maybe he is the god on the board, however he is not the god of the land. It's something similar in our own lifes; we cannot control the world we live in, but we can control our own minds to be the masters of ourselves. Another sentence is his attitude to something around: he showed great disrespect for both the regulations and the jazz. Maybe we all wanted to live a life with freedom and carelessness, but we are always constrained by the "regualtions". Maybe we didn't accomplished anything, and what we have done were vanished with the "ship". Yet even so, when we face the end -- like the "recording" being replayed, we also lived a life we imagined, loved someone/something we treasured, and we can proudly say, "fuck the world". 

When I was surfing the Internet, I saw someone suggest that 1900 was actually Max on the deck, and the whole story was imaginary. I have to say this kind of view made sense to me with their explanations, but I strongly wished 1900 had really lived once, since almost everyone had a 1900 in their heart. In a nutshell, the reality is not important, as long as "you have a good story and someone to talk to". 

> Good night to all, and wish we can all be our own 1900 in the world!

# 🌊 The Legend of 1900 — A Reflection

A few days ago, I watched an old but timeless film called The Legend of 1900 (1998), and I want to record some of my thoughts here.

The plot may seem simple, even a little cliché: a genius is born as an orphan aboard the ship Virginia in the first month of 1900. He grows up to become an extraordinary pianist, living his entire life above the ocean. He falls in love with a girl, yet never sets foot on land to see her again — held back by a quiet fear of the world beyond the sea. In the end, he remains with the decaying ship as it is blown apart, choosing to vanish with the only home he ever knew.

The story is told through the memories of Max, a trumpeter who once played with 1900. Max leaves the ship before the war and later falls into financial hardship, forced to sell his beloved trumpet to survive. Through his eyes, we witness the legend — a man who lived and died between two worlds, bound to the rhythm of the sea.

What first drew me in was the actor Tim Roth, whom I already knew from Lie to Me, where he played Dr. Lightman — a sharp, confident expert in microexpressions, sometimes too confident for those around him. Here, however, Roth becomes someone utterly different: a boyish soul untouched by land, living purely through music. That purity made him not only brilliant but almost sacred. When 1900 played for both the aristocrats and the workers, he poured his entire being into the piano. Watching him, I began to feel a quiet envy — not for his talent, but for his complete devotion to something he truly loved. So when he refused to leave the ship, when he chose to disappear with it, that moment broke my heart — all the more because he faced it with gentle humor.

There are so many moments and lines that linger with me. 1900 was too shy even to greet the girl he admired. When he finally decided to disembark, he stopped halfway down the stairs, dizzy and uncertain. That image stayed with me. Just as he once teased others — “Lose your sea legs?” — we all have our own comfort zones, and our own fears. It is good to be brave, to challenge the unknown. But it is also okay to remain where our hearts feel at home, as long as we love the life we choose.

One of my favorite ideas in the film is 1900’s view of the ocean and the land. He said that the keys on a piano — like life on a ship — are finite, while the buildings on land are infinite. On the ship, he could be a god; on land, he would be lost. It reminds me of our own lives: we can’t control the world around us, but we can rule our own minds, become the masters of our inner worlds.

1900 also mocked rules and jazz, as if rebelling against every convention. Maybe that’s what we all secretly wish for — a life of freedom and carefreeness. Yet we are always bound by some invisible regulation. Maybe, like the ship, our lives will one day vanish, and all we’ve done will fade like music when the record stops. But even then, if we’ve lived the life we dreamed of, loved someone or something deeply, we can still smile and whisper, “fuck the world.”

Later, I came across an interpretation online — that 1900 was just Max’s imagination, a creation born from nostalgia and regret. It’s a clever idea, and it makes sense, but I still want to believe that 1900 truly lived. Because everyone carries a part of him inside — that quiet, untouched self who dreams freely, fears the unknown, and lives sincerely. In the end, whether he was real or not doesn’t matter, as long as “you have a good story and someone to talk to.”

> Good night to all, and may we each become our own 1900 in this vast, uncertain world.
