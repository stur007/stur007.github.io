## Chapter 11 The weak interaction

### The weak charged-current interaction

The charged-current weak interaction is mediated by massive charged $W^\pm$ bosons and consequently couples together fermions differing by one unit of electric charge. It is also the only place in the Standard Model where parity is not conserved.  

### Parity

#### Intrinsic parity

For Dirac spinors, $\hat P = \gamma^0$ and $\hat P\hat P = I$.

#### Parity conservation in QED

Let's verify the law of conservation of parity in QED process:

For a QED process, 

$$
M = \frac{Q_qe^2}{q^2}j_e\cdot j_q =\frac{Q_qe^2}{q^2}g_{\mu\nu}j_e^\mu j_q^\nu
$$

And

$$
j_e^\mu = \bar u(p_3)\gamma^\mu u(p_1)\\
j_q^\nu = \bar u(p_4)\gamma^\nu u(p_2)
$$

For parity transformation, 

$$
u^\prime = \gamma^0 u\\
\bar {u^\prime} = u{^\prime}^\dagger\gamma^0 = u^\dagger \gamma^0\gamma^0 = \bar u \gamma^0
$$

Thus

$$
{j_e^\prime}^0 = \bar{u^\prime}(p_3)\gamma^0 u^\prime(p_1) = \bar u(p_3)\gamma^0\gamma^0\gamma^0 u(p_1)= \bar u(p_3)\gamma^0 u(p_1)\\
{j_e^\prime}^i = \bar{u^\prime}(p_3)\gamma^i u^\prime(p_1) = \bar u(p_3)\gamma^0\gamma^i\gamma^0 u(p_1)= -\bar u(p_3)\gamma^i u(p_1)
$$

Similarly, 

$$
j_q^0 = \bar u(p_4)\gamma^0 u(p_2)\\
j_q^i = \bar u(p_4)\gamma^i u(p_2)
$$

Therefore

$$
j_e^\prime\cdot j_q^\prime = j_e^0j_q^0-\sum_{i=1}^3(-j_e^i)(-j_q^i) = j_e\cdot j_q
$$

Thus

$$
M^\prime=M
$$

This invariance implies that **parity is conserved in QED**.

Analogously **parity is conserved in QCD**.

##### Scalars, pseudoscalars, vectors and axial vectors

> Helicity: $h \propto S\cdot p $.

### V-A structure of the weak interaction

It turns out that there are only five combinations of individual $\gamma$-matrices that have the correct Lorentz transformation properties, such that they can be combined into a Lorentz-invariant matrix element.

> where $\gamma^5 = \gamma^0\gamma^1\gamma^2\gamma^3$ measures the chirality.

If this is restricted to the exchange of a spin-1 (vector) boson, the most general form for the interaction is a linear combination of vector and axial vector currents,  

$$
j^\mu \propto g_V\bar u(p^\prime)\gamma^\mu u(p)+g_a\bar u(p^\prime)\gamma^\mu\gamma^5u(p)
$$

For weak interaction process, we have

$$
j^\mu = \frac {g_W} {\sqrt 2} \bar u(p^\prime)\frac 1 2\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)u(p)
$$

### Chiral structure of the weak interaction 

It is obvious that 

$$
j^\mu = \frac {g_W} {\sqrt 2} \bar u(p^\prime)\gamma^\mu P_Lu(p) = \frac {g_W} {\sqrt 2} \overline {P_L u(p^\prime)}\gamma^\mu u(p)
$$

So the interaction apparently only involves left-handed particles., thus the parity is not conserved in this process.

### The W-boson propagator

The original propagator is plausibly

$$
\frac 1 {q^2-m_W^2}
$$

After considering all the polarization, 

$$
\frac{-\mathrm i }{q^2-m_W^2}\left(g_{\mu\nu}-\frac {q_\mu q_\nu}{m_W^2}\right)
$$

#### Fermi theory

$$
M  = -\left[\frac {g_W} {\sqrt 2} \bar \psi_3\frac 1 2\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)\psi_1\right]
\cdot \frac{1}{q^2-m_W^2}\left(g_{\mu\nu}-\frac {q_\mu q_\nu}{m_W^2}\right)
\cdot \left[\frac {g_W} {\sqrt 2} \bar \psi_4\frac 1 2\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)\psi_2\right]
$$

when $q \ll m_W^2$, we have

$$
M  = \frac{g_W^2}{8}
\cdot \left[ \bar \psi_3\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)\psi_1\right]
\cdot \frac{g_{\mu\nu}}{m_W^2}
\cdot \left[ \bar \psi_4\gamma^\mu (1-\gamma^5)\psi_2\right]
$$

And the Fermi constant

$$
G_F =\frac{\sqrt 2\,g_W^2}{8}
$$
