Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

This is my very first blog post on my personal site powered by **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages**.

I'm planning to use this space to share:
- My thoughts on technology and programming
- Personal projects and experiments
- Notes from my learning journey
- Occasional tips, tutorials, or reflections

Stay tuned for more updates!

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:yutongren@stu.pku.edu.cn) or explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/stur007) if you're curious about what I'm working on.

> Thanks for visiting!
