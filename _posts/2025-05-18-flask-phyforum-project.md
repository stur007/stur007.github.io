I’ve recently launched a intricate personal project called **PhyForum**, a web application built with Flask, MySQL, and Bootstrap. It’s currently under active development, and I'm excited to share its progress!

## 🚀 Project Overview

**PhyForum** is a lightweight blogging-style platform where users can register, verify their email, create posts, and interact through comments. The goal is to keep things minimal, educational, and fully functional.

## 🔧 Recent Updates (as of 2025-05-18)

- ✨ Redesigned the editing interface for posts and comments
- 🔐 Added **email verification** – users must register with a valid email address
- 🧼 Users can now **delete their account** via the profile page
- 📮 A `mailto:` contact link has been added on the homepage to encourage feedback (since the site is still experimental)

## 💡 Features

- User registration and login with email verification
- Create, edit, and delete posts/comments (with permission control)
- Admin/user role system
- Personal profile management
- Contact link for feedback

I plan to keep improving the UI and potentially deploy the project online.  
Any suggestions or feedback are welcome. 🙌
